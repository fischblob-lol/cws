# cws
scripting language for the "CatWeb" roblox game: 
currently barely anything done yet
im planning to add Shitdows (Windows) support, but Linux first
if youd ask me how many % im done id say 0.1% haha
to install on linux/windows, only download the install.sh and run it, the rest is automated!
(you can also try manual installation if you want to but i doubt itll work
